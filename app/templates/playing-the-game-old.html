                    <h1>Playing the game</h1>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Setup</h2>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li><h4>Shuffle</h4>Each player shuffles his or her deck. Each player may then shuffle or cut their opponentsâ€™
                            decks.</li>
                        <li><h4>Determine turn order</h4>Players determine which player will go first (by flipping a coin, rolling dice, etc.).</li>
                        <li><h4>Draw 7 Cards</h4>Each player draws a number of cards equal to their hand size (hand sizes are seven cards unless
                            otherwise modified). A player who is dissatisfied with their initial hand may take a mulligan.
                            To take a mulligan, the starting player first declares that they will take a mulligan. He or she
                            shuffles his or her hand back into their deck and redraws their hand (This process can be
                            repeated multiple times if desired.). For each mulligan taken, that player must put that many
                            cards from their hand on the bottom of their deck.</li>
                        <li><h4>20 Life</h4>Each player starts with 20 life (some game variants may have different starting life totals)
                            which they are responsible for keeping track of (via dice, pen & paper, etc.).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Winning</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>A player wins the game when all of their opponents have been eliminated (Though uncommon, it is possible for noone to win.). A player is eliminated from the game
                        when either of the following happens:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>His or her life total is reduced to 0 or below</li>
                        <li>He or she has to draw a card but cannot because their library has no cards remaining, or</li>
                        <li>He or she has ten or more poison counters, they lose the game. (A player receives a poison counter for each life lost from a source with infect.)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Additionally, certain cards may create alternate win or loss conditions that when met can lead to
                        a win.</p>

                    <h2>Structure</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>	Magic is a turn based game in which players take alternating turns. Each turn contains 5 phases, three of which are broken down further into steps. Certain phases require certain turn based actions to be performed such as untapping permanents, drawing a card, etc.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Phases</h2>

                        <li>Attacking: Creatures tap then they attack</li>
                        <li>Add Mana: Lands make mana when you tap them</li>
                        <li>Activating abilities: Some permanents are tapped as a cost for their activated abilities</li>
